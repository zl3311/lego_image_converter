# lego_image_converter
 A simple program that converts an image to a Lego-fied picture.

---
## Background
Here's how this simple package started. 

Originally, I purchased [Lego Art Project 21226](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/art-project-create-together-21226)
(now retired) as the Thanksgiving gift for myself back in 2022, but I didn't have the chance to 
put up the pieces, since recession is kind of suffocating many folks, including myself.

It is until mid 2023 that I finally have some room to breath, and I realize that I haven't opened this toy that 
has been sitting in the corner of my room 
for like 8 months or so. 
So I reckon it's probably a decent timing to bring some innocent joy back to my life. 

The main bummer is that Lego includes merely enough blocks only to build the 
images in their instruction 
(like blue blocks are most common (660 pieces), but considering a 48x48=2304 canvas, it means you need colorful 
background otherwise you'll run out of some colors), and that is not enough if you want to do something fancy. 
I understand that Lego is for-profit company, and real hardcore Lego players spend tons of money 
on buying customized blocks themselves. Still, I feel like Lego is not generous enough for such a brilliant idea on
this Art Project product. 

Another issue is that there isn't a tool that automatically converts a random image into a prototype as if you were to 
build it in Lego, which means you might spend tons of time working on something that is undesirable, 
and we adults are short on time. This is the reason why I build this package. You're welcome, Lego Engineering team.

Don't get me wrong: I'm still a huge fan of Lego, 
and I hope this package can save Lego players and possibly programmers some time.

## How to use
Please install the package using
